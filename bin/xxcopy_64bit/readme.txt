             Simply, a Logical Extension to XCOPY.

   XXCOPY is simply a logical extension to XCOPY.  It remains
   faithfully compatible with XCOPY in the invocation syntax,
   yet, adds many innovative features to be a very serious
   utility for anyone who feels comfortable in managing files
   in command line mode (DOS Box).  XXCOPY has grown to be not
   just a file copy program but also a file removal, search and
   list utility.  Its short name preserving capability makes it
   ideal to clone a system disk which can be made bootable.
   XXCOPY runs under Windows XP/Vista/2003/Win7/Win8/2008.
   In short, it is an industrial strenth utility for system
   administrators.

  Once you download the distribution file (usually named like
  xxcopy.zip or xxfw3116.zip), unzip it into a temporary
  directory (e.g., c:\temp).


  This package contains the following files:

  readme.txt     ; this file
  install.bat    ; run this batch program without an argument
  xxcopy.exe     ; Win XP/Vista/2003/Win7/Win8/2008 (xxcopy.exe)
  xxcopysu.exe   ; Win XP/Vista/2003/Win7/Win8/2008(std user)
  xxpbar64.exe   ; The Progress Bar display module
  xxconsole.exe  ; a Super Console Generator
  xxcopy.chm     ; HTML-style help file
  uixxcopy.bat   ; uninstall the xxcopy*.exe files

    -----------------------------------------------------------------
     NOTE: If you are a licensee of the XXCOPY PRO Edition, and are
           interested in updating your copy of XXCOPY with the newer
           version, this package is probably not for you.  This
           package contains the XXCOPY Freeware which is not the same
           thing as the XXCOPY-PRO Edition even with the presence of
           the license (XXCOPY.LIC) file.  You must obtain your
           update package directly from XXCOPY's home page.  If you
           have any question, please contact Pixelab for details. 
    -----------------------------------------------------------------

 #### CAUTION #### CAUTION #### CAUTION #### CAUTION #### CAUTION ####
  For Vista, Win7, Win8, and Server 2008 environments, make sure that
  you open a DOS Box with the Administrator privilege to install the
  XXCOPY program.  The title bar of the console window should display
  "Administrator:" at the top left corner of the window.  Failing to
  do so may divert the XXCOPY-related files into a virtualized system
  directory that is not the desired location in the installation step.
 #####################################################################

  To install the XXCOPY Freeware package, make current the temporary
  directory where the above files are stored; for example, at the
  user prompt of a DOS Box run the following command:
  
     CD  c:\temp

  Then, run the INSTALL.BAT program without any argument
  
     INSTALL

  The batch program is equivalent to "XXCOPY /INSTALL" but it
  will generate a few extra help text at the completion of
  the "XXCOPY /INSTALL" operation.
  
  As a self-sufficient program, the XXCOPY.EXE file can be placed
  (and executed) at any directory, or even renamed to other name
  when appropriate without adverse effect.  In most circumstances,
  it is best to keep it in a directory which is in the "PATH="
  Environment variable so that the program is readily available
  whatever the current directory setting is at any give time.



Documentations for the programs are available in three ways.


1. Short command switch summary.

     Run XXCOPY with the /? switch.

       Example:    xxcopy /?


2. Full command switch display.

     Run XXCOPY with the /help switch.
     Since the output is more than one page, it is
     best you view one page at a time with "| MORE"

       Example:    xxcopy /help | more

                   xxcopy /helpa | more    (for alphabetic listing)


3. Web-based documentation (The most complete of the three).

     Visit the following web site:

       http://www.xxcopy.com

     And look for documentation and update information.
